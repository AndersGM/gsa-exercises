## Read-mapping

Download the read-mapping tool [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa). You can do this either by downloading a [zip-file](https://github.com/lh3/bwa/archive/master.zip) or by cloning the git repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git
```

After downloading (and unzipping if you downloaded the zip-file), go to the directory and make the tool

```sh
$ cd bwa
$ make
```
